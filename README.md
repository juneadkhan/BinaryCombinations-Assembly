# BinaryCombinations in Assembly Language 0️⃣1️⃣1️⃣0️⃣

Given a positive integer number N, this programme generates all the possible binary combinations of N bits. This implementation is done via recursion. The code uses MIPS Stack Allocation/Deallocation conventions.

- **Recursive Solution** following MIPS Calling Conventions
- Written in **Assembly Language** for the **MIPS** Architecture.
- MIPS is a **RISC Instruction Set Architecture**
- Written, Tested and Simulated using **MARS MIPS Simulator** ([MSU](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/))
